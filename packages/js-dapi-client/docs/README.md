> Client library used to access Dash DAPI endpoints

This library enables HTTP-based interaction with the Dash blockchain and Dash
Platform via the decentralized API ([DAPI](https://github.com/dashevo/dapi))
hosted on Dash masternodes.

 - `DAPI-Client` provides automatic server (masternode) discovery using either a default seed node or a user-supplied one
 - `DAPI-Client` maps to DAPI's [RPC](https://github.com/dashevo/dapi/tree/master/lib/rpcServer/commands) and [gRPC](https://github.com/dashevo/dapi/tree/master/lib/grpcServer/handlers) endpoints
